Basically my previous chrome extension on steroids

Uses Flickr API to aggregate photos and their tags<br>
Tags fed to a similarity matrix, clustering them into groups using k-means algorithm<br>
Groups fed as features to neural network, used to predict user's photo preferences. 

####Tl;dr
Uses machine learning to predict which photos the user likes, and displays them
